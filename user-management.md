## User Management

To implement the requirements for creating and managing users for the three different companies (AA, BB, and CC) and allowing them to log in, input additional information, and manage their profiles we'll follow a step-by-step approach. This will involve:

- Database Setup: Define a PostgreSQL database schema to store user information.
- Backend API: Develop Node.js/Express API endpoints to handle user creation, login, profile updates, and deletions.
- Frontend Components: Create React components for login, profile management, and handling CRUD operations.
- Form Management: Use React hooks to manage form state and integrate with the backend.
- State Management: Use React Context for authentication state and user data management.Persisting Data: Ensure data persists on reload using state and API integration.

## 1. Database Setup
First, let's define the PostgreSQL database schema to store user data:

```
-- Create users table to store user information
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    company VARCHAR(50),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    address TEXT,
    tel VARCHAR(15),
    hobby TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert initial users for companies AA, BB, and CC
INSERT INTO users (name, email, company) VALUES 
('Joe', 'joe@compAA.com', 'AA'),
('Anna', 'anna@compBB.com', 'BB'),
('Jake', 'jake@compCC.com', 'CC');


```

## Summary

The above setup allows for complete user management in a React application, ensuring data persistence and seamless user experience.
- Database: PostgreSQL schema for storing user data.
- Backend: Node.js/Express API for managing CRUD operations.
- Frontend: React components for login, profile management, and CRUD operations.
- State Management: React Context API for handling authentication state.
- Persisting Data: Local storage to maintain user sessions across reloads.
